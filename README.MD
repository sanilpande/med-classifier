This is an experiment for developing and training a classifier to classify CT scans as positive, false-positive, or false-negative.

The self defined model is inspired by the following literature:

[Classification of MRI Migraine Medical Data using 3D Convolutional Neural Network](https://www2.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/wtm/publications/2018/NKMMW18/Ng_et_al_3DCNN_2018.pdf).

Group ICA for rs-fMRI Measurements](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331018114_Evaluation_of_Functional_Decline_in_Alzheimer's_Dementia_Using_3D_Deep_Learning_and_Group_ICA_for_rs-fMRI_Measurements/fulltext/5c617e75299bf1d14cbcb195/Evaluation-of-Functional-Decline-in-Alzheimers-Dementia-Using-3D-Deep-Learning-and-Group-ICA-for-rs-fMRI-Measurements.pdf)

`res3d.py` has this 3D implementation of ResNet architectures:

`test.py` contains a script for obtaining the test and train accuracies.

`main.py` contains the code for selecting and training the models.
